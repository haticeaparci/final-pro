# 🍔 Food Order App

A Food Ordering App built from scratch with modern React + Vite and a serverless architecture.  
Designed with a QA mindset, fully tested, and built to be scalable and maintainable.

## ✨ Key Features

- ⚡ **Modern Stack**: React 19 + Vite for high performance and maintainable code.
- 🎨 **Custom UI & Hooks**: Reusable `CustomButton`, `useCart`, and `useOrder` for clean and modular code.
- 🛒 **Full Order Flow**: Cart → Checkout → Order Confirmation.
- ✅ **Serverless Integration**: Powered by Vercel functions, global access without a traditional backend.
- 🧪 **Testing Culture**: Checkout flow fully tested with Jest + React Testing Library from a QA perspective.
- 🔒 **Rapid MVP**: Security (XSS, etc.) intentionally deprioritized → prototype-focused, serverless functions for fast iteration.

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

- 🛠 **From Scratch & QA-Driven**: Critical flows designed and tested end-to-end.
- ♻️ **Reusable & Modular**: Scalable UI components and custom hooks.
- ☁️ **Serverless & Scalable**: Modern architecture with global accessibility, no backend required.
- ✅ **Test-First Approach**: QA perspective ensures regressions are minimized.
